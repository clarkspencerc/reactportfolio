# React Portfolio

## Description 

My new portfolio page built in react. I have built sections to display my projects, learn more about my interestes, download my resume, and a place to send me a message. 

## Technologies Used

* React
* Express.js
* CSS 
* HTML 

## Lessons Learned 
I learned how to build and deploy a react app and use some of the different packages available to react apps. I really like the simplicity of being able to display new and different content without having to build complex routes.
